                        CBD is readily obtainable in most parts of the United States,
                        though its exact legal status has been in flux. All 50 states
                        have laws legalizing CBD with varying degrees of restriction.
                        In December 2015, the FDA eased the regulatory requirements
                        to allow researchers to conduct CBD trials. In 2018,
                        the Farm Bill made hemp legal in the United States,
                        making it virtually impossible to keep CBD illegal â€”
                        that would be like making oranges legal, but keeping
                        orange juice illegal. <strong>read the full article...</strong>

                    By now, you've probably run into a product containing cannabidiol,
                    also known as CBD. It is in everything from drinks and pet products
                    to lotions and chewable gummies. Even major drugstore chains
                    have announced they will start carrying CBD products in
                    certain states. <strong>read the full article...</strong>
