# Deployment and Payment setup

- The app was deployed to [Heoku](https://render.com/).
- The database was deployed to [CI PostgreSQL](https://dbs.ci-dbs.net/) in production
- The static and media file were deployed using [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) in production
---
- The app can be reached by the [link](https://natures-elixir-64c04e0a2408.herokuapp.com/).

## Payment Setup

1. Register a stripe account at https://dashboard.stripe.com/register.
2. Go to the developers' page:

3. Select API keys.

4. Copy the `public key` and `secret key` to the `env.py` file, or set them in your environment.

5. Add the following setting to `settings.py`:

```python
  STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = os.environ.get("STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY")
  STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get("STRIPE_SECRET_KEY")
```

6. Install stripe package:

```python
  pip3 install stripe
```

7. Create an order model with the required fields in the orders app.
8. Set up a payment app.
9. Add a payment form to the payment app template.
10. Add div to hold stripe element:

```html
  <div id="stripe-element"></div>
```
11. Create a View to handle payment setup:
  - Get public key: `stripe_public_key = settings.STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY`
  - Get private key: `stripe_secret_key = settings.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
  - create intent: `intent = stripe.PaymentIntent.create(**kwargs)`
  - **kwargs for the payment intent should include:
    * `amount`: amount
    * `currency`: currency
    * `metadata`: metadata
  - For the metadata, I have user id `userid: request.user.id`
  - Create context for the view with the following data:
      *  'my_profile': my_profile,
      *  'total_sum': total_sum,
      *  'client_secret': intent.client_secret,
      *  'stripe_public_key': stripe_public_key,

12. Add extra js block to payment template where you have to add csrf_token, stripe_public_key,
  script tag with stripe.js, and script tag with payment.js.

```html
  {% block postloadjs_extra %}
    <script>
        let CSRF_TOKEN = '{{ csrf_token }}';
        let stripe_public_key = '{{ stripe_public_key }}';
    </script>
    <script src="https://js.stripe.com/v3/"></script>
    <script src="{% static 'js/payment.js' %}" data-rel-js></script>
  {% endblock %}
```

13. In the payment.js, create variables for stripe public key, stripe, payment element, payment form, and a variable from which you will receive 'client_secret.' To get 'client secret,` I have added data-attribute to confirmation button in the payment form:

```html
  data-secret="{{ client_secret }}"
```
14. Set up stripe element:

```javascript
  let elements = stripe.elements();
  let style = {
    base: {
      color: "#000",
      lineHeight: '2.4',
      fontSize: '16px'
    }
  };
  let card = elements.create("card", {
    style: style
  });
  card.mount("#card-element");
```

*You can use various styling by checking out the following docs [stripe/elements-examples](https://github.com/stripe/elements-examples)*

15. Get all data from the payment form and collect it by using `new FormData()`

16. Create an AJAX request to send collected data and set the url to for adding order. The URL is `window.location.origin + '/orders/add/'`.

17. In the orders app views, you need to create a view to handle order creation.

18. The payment intent is created when the user clicks on the confirmation button. That stripe element prevents the user from multiple clicks and handles all errors. However, you must set alerts for the user to show the error.

19. To test the user's payment, you need to create a test payment intent with the card data provided by the stripe:

No auth: 4242424242424242

Auth: 4000002500003155

Error: 4000000000009995

20. Create a success page to redirect the user after successful payment and add js functionality to handle the redirection:

```javascript
    if (result.paymentIntent.status === 'succeeded') {
      window.location.replace(window.location.origin + "/payment/order_placed/");
    }
```

21. Set app stripe backend:
  - Go to [Stripe Docs. Stripe CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli)
  - Download the stripe-cli file depending on your operating system.
  - Go to the link provided and download the file.
  - Open the downloaded file and move the file `stripe` to the project's root directory.
  - Open the terminal and type:

  `./stripe login`

  *Note! For the window OS, the command looks as follows `stripe login`*

  - Hit enter -> You will be redirected to the Stripe dashboard, where you need to allow access to your local workspace.

  - Create a payment, and the intent will be created.

  *Another option:*
  
  - Download the following file:

  - Open the downloads folder in the terminal and type:

  `sudo gdebi stripe_1.11.0_linux_amd64.deb`

  - The package will be installed -> Type `stripe` in the terminal and hit enter.

22. Create a function in the orders views to handle the payment confirmation, which will take payment data. This function will also handle email confirmation.

23. To run this function, you will need to add the following process provided by stripe:

```python
from django.views.decorators.csrf import csrf_exempt

@csrf_exempt
  def stripe_webhook(request):
      payload = request.body
      event = None
      try:
          event = stripe.Event.construct_from(
              json.loads(payload), stripe.api_key
          )
      except ValueError as e:
          return HttpResponse(status=400)
      # Handle the event
      if event.type == 'payment_intent.succeeded':
          payment_confirmation(event.data.object.client_secret)
      else:
          print('Unhandled event type {}'.format(event.type))
      return HttpResponse(status=200)
```

24. Add URL to the stripe_webhook function in the payment urls.py

```python
    path('webhook/', stripe_webhook),
```

25. In the terminal type:

`./stripe listen --forward-to localhost:8000/payment/webhook/`

26. Remember to set app stripe data in Heroku configs:

  - Create a webhook in the stripe dashboard and set the hosted endpoint.


  - `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY`
  - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
  - `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

## Heroku Deployment


1. Create a Heroku account if you don't already have one.

2. Create a new app on Heroku.

    1. Go to the [Heroku dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps).
    2. Click on the "New" button.
    3. Click on the "Create new app" button.
    4. Choose a name for your app.
    5. Choose a region.
    6. Click on the "Create app" button.

3. In your app go to the "Resources" tab.

    1. Add a Heroku Postgres database.

4. In your app, go to the "Settings" tab, press "Reveal Config Vars", and add the following config vars if they are not already set:

    1. ```ALLOWED_HOSTS``` = your heroku domain name.
    2. ```CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME``` = the cloud name you used when creating your cloudinary account.
    3. ```CLOUDINARY_API_KEY``` = the api key you got when created your cloudinary account.
    4. ```CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET``` = the api secret you got when created your cloudinary account.
    5. ```DATABASE_URL``` = the url of your heroku postgres database.
    6. ```REDIS_URL``` = the url of your heroku redis database.
    7. ```SECRET_KEY``` = a secret key for your app.
    8. ```EMAIL_HOST_USER``` = the email address you going to use to send emails.
    9. ```EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD``` = the password for the email address you are using.
    10. ```DEBUG``` = True during development, False during production.
    11. ```DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC``` = 1 during development. Remove this when deploying to production.
    12. ```STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY``` = the public key you got when created your stripe account.
    13. ```STRIPE_SECRET_KEY``` = the secret key you got when created your stripe account.
    14. ```STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET``` = the secret key you got when created your stripe webhook.

5. In your app go to the "Deploy" tab.

    1. If it's already possible, connect your Heroku account to your GitHub account and then click on the "Deploy" button.
    2. If not, you need to copy the Heroku CLI command to connect your heroku app and your local repository.

        - ```heroku git:remote -a <your-heroku-app-name>```

6. Go to your local repository.

7. Login to your Heroku account in your terminal and connect your local repository to your heroku app.

    1. ```heroku login -i``` - Enter all your Heroku credentials it will ask for.
    2. Paste the command you copied from step 5 into your terminal.

8. Create Procfile.

    This project uses Daphne server for its ability to run asynchronous applications in order to implement tech support chats in the future, so in this case if you want to implement chat functionality as well, you have to add the following to Procfile:

    - ```release: python manage.py migrate``` - this command will apply all migrations every time you re-deploy the app.
    - ```web: daphne ecommerce_project.asgi:application --port $PORT --bind 0.0.0.0 -v2``` - this command will run the app.
    - ```worker: python manage.py runworker -v2 channel_layer``` - this command will run the worker for the channel layer to run the async tasks.

9. Create ```requirements.txt```. This can be done by running the following command:

    - ```pip freeze > requirements.txt```
    or
    - ```pipreqs requirements.txt``` - if you have pipreqs installed.

10. Add and commit all changes.

11. Push your changes to Heroku.

    - ```git push heroku master```
    or
    - ```git push heroku main```

12. Check your app's logs in heroku dashboard and ensure everything is working.

13. After the development is done, you can change the ```DEBUG``` config var to ```False``` and remove the ```DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC``` config var from the config vars on heroku.
